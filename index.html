        The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art
    </h2>
    <p>
        One of the exhibits you must see while there is the <b>Photography exhibit</b>, specifically the print they have of Dorothea Lange's <i>Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California</i>, a rather haunting photo of a mother and her two children from 1936 in a camp for field workers.
        Another exhibit you have to see is the <b>Donald J. Hall Sculpture Park</b>, which is out on the front lawn of the museum, which includes the giant shuttlecocks that are synonymous with the museum.
