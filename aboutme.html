        <h1>Ben Weddle</h1>
        <p>I am a 6th year senior here at NWMSU. I was a Chemistry major here before I was a CS major here, but after PChem I decided that it was not for me.
            I have played guitar for the last 11 years.

        <h2>Scott Pilgrim VS the World</h2>
        <p>
            I like this movie because it's based on a graphic novel that I really enkoy about a guy named Scott who has to fight all of his girlfriends evil exes to keep dating her in
            a very videogame kind of way. There is a lot of classic videogame music and tropes in the movie. Even though it is a stupid movie (on a level akin to Napoleon Dynamite) it's
            packed with big Hollywood names, including Captain America himself Chris Evans.
